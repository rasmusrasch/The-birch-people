# The-birch-people
The birch people is a fun book about a world where birch creatures comes to life and take over the world. 

I love writing but sadly I am not a very good writer. 

A few years ago i finished the Nanowrimo challange together with my sister Alexandra Rasch. The challenge was to write a book in one month with atleast 50 000 words. Sadly after finishing i never managed to make it through truly finishing it. After 4 years i have decided to give up my ownership and unleash it to the community. Hopefully some hero will build and improve this book.
